### About the Program

The Nanoscale Materials and Device Group has developed an easy-to-use, interactive simulation tool for complex, multi-layer dielectric, MOS and MIM devices. This program is useful for visualizing approximations of energy band diagrams, and performing back-of-the-envelope calculations of their important parameters.
